Comments to the author
======================

This paper describes the use of closed-loop control for
testing of cardiac devices - the authors employ a virtual
heart model using finite state machines to generate
requirements and pacemaker-like signals that are assessed
against the requirements that best reflect the behaviour
(including malfunctioning) of the cardiac device.
