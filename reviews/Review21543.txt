Reviewer 4 of EMBC'15 submission 2332

Comments to the author
======================

Authors reported a closed-loop testing setup for cardiac
implant.
The aim is interesting,and worth for presentation&#12290;
For that purpose, sufficient refer and describe should be
required.
However, the reference of this paper is unsatisfied, and
the readers cannot understand the usefulness of this
device.
The authors would be better to describe the prefer page
number to search the past data for the readers.
There was a lot of reports describing the Virtual Heart
from the various points of view. But no reference was noted
in this paper.
It will be better to rewrite this paper from precise past
findings concerning the virtual heart and note the new
findings in your model. This discussion will be useful for
the reader to understand.
