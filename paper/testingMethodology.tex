We now describe how we can generate PVC waveforms automatically in a requirements-guided manner.


It must be stressed that the interpretation of closed-loop testing results (bug or feature of the pacemaker?) depends on the specific violating behaviors that are found.
Some will be determined to be bugs. 
Others will be determined to be undesirable but necessary behaviors.
This is because specifying `safe' behavior is difficult for something as complex as the heart.
