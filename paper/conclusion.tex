\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusion}

In this paper, we demonstrated a closed-loop testing methodology that uses a specification-guided tester to find unsafe and undesirable heart conditions.
The advantages over open-loop were outlined and demonstrated in experiments involving our Virtual Heart Model.
In future work, we will apply this testing setup to the Heart-on-a-Chip platform, thus allowing us to test real pacemakers in an automatic manner.
It will also allow us to explore the range of parameters for the pacemaker for which safe operation can be guaranteed, and the environmental conditions (e.g., frequency of PVCs and PACs) under which these guarantees hold.
