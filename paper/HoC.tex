Our closed-loop testing scheme ranges across different stages of the development process. 
In particular, it can be performed not only on pacemaker models and code, but also on off-the-shelf pacemaker devices. Fig.~\figref{hoc} shows the Heart-on-a-Chip (HoC) platform for closed-loop testing of pacemakers. 
The platform consists of a micro-controller running the code of the VHM, and an analog interface that converts heart signals
