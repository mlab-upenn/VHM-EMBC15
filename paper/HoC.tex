Our closed-loop testing scheme ranges across different stages of the development process. 
In particular, it can be performed not only on pacemaker models and code, but also on off-the-shelf pacemaker devices. Fig.~\figref{hoc} shows the Heart-on-a-Chip (HoC) platform for closed-loop testing of pacemakers. 
The platform consists of a micro-controller running the code of the VHM, and an analog interface to the pacemaker. The analog interface converts heart model outputs to physiological heart signals, which will be input to the pacemaker, and converts pacemaker pacing signal to node activation events.  An user interface on the host computer monitors the closed-loop interaction between the heart and the pacemaker and violations to the physiological requirements will be reported.
