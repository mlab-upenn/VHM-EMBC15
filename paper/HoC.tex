Our closed-loop testing scheme can be performed not only on pacemaker models and code, but also on off-the-shelf pacemaker devices. 
\figref{hoc} shows the Heart-on-a-Chip (HoC) platform for closed-loop testing of pacemakers. 
The platform consists of a micro-controller running the code of the VHM, and an analog interface to the pacemaker. 
The analog interface converts VHM outputs to physiological heart signals, which will be input to the pacemaker, and converts pacemaker pacing signals to node activation events.  
A user interface on the host computer monitors the closed-loop interaction between the heart and the pacemaker and violations to the physiological requirements are reported.
