Introduction \\
= Currently, pacemakers are tested in open loop with directed tests (recordings from old devices and validator)
\\
= It is important to understand the physiological effects of the device -> need to study its operation when connected to a heart
\\
= We developed a heart model to do this closed-loop testing, and a HoC platform
\\
= we applied specification-guided testing
\\
= Describe heart??

Method \\
= SS: Heart model 
\\
= SS: Pacemaker model
\\
= SS: HoC 
\\
= SS: Closed-loop.
Table comparing closed-loop with open-loop.
Robustness-guided testing.


Experiments \\
= VSP feature
\\
= ELT
